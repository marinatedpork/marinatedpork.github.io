			<h1>Wireframed</h1>
			<h2>July 24, 2014</h2>
			<p>The first thing I did when redesigning my index page was ask my "how do I want my user to feel on my page?". My answer: curious, impacted. I wanted something with power. I wanted something with a "Landing Page" feeling. I wanted the use of color to be minimal yet very pronounced. I wanted to use my own photos. So, that is what I created</p>

			<p>I use a lot of oversized post-it pads, so the first part of my wireframe was without a doubt hand-drawn. I benefit a lot from the fluidity of the hand-drawn brainstorming process. See below for my goofy phase 1 wire frame:</p>

			<p>Pretty simple layout plans in that photo. Next I wanted to sketch out how I was going to display links to my work on my website, so I sketched up a quick CSS wire-frame for the pigs, descriptions and how I was going to implement them:</p>

			<p>As you can see I applied my new found <em>display</em> knowledge buy wrapping a couple in-blocks in a block to make for smooth layout planning.  Finally I just needed to update my old post for the new look and then link everything together.  For making that less confusing, I created a color coded chart for wiring all the sites together:</p>

			<p>I hope everyone likes the new layout.</p>
