            Pair-programming seems integral for concise, efficient developing. 
            Not only does it help the process of debugging, but it solidifies 
            your own under understanding of the material. Specifically for DBC, 
            peer programming seems like a great way to expand your knowledge 
            base because we are all coming from a very different background. One 
            person might know more about front-end while another person may be 
            better at back-end. Either way, it always helps to have another set 
            of eyes on the screen.

        <p id="bottom-paragraph">
            I for one really enjoy pairing because I learn well through discourse. Asking questions and discussing with my partner is a great way for me to get a handle on things. What works well is dividing the labor so that you can efficiently develop the website. What's a bit more difficult is organizing your thoughts or sharing a vision for what you'd like to develop.
