      <h2>Responsive Design</h2>

      <br>
      <p>Responsive web design is the implementation of pixel breakpoints on stylesheets to maximize usability. Pixel breakpoints are boundaries you set that, once crossed by a dimensions of the user's display, initialize different style rules. For example, a designer could increase font size at a width of 320px to make content easier to read for users with a smart phone.</p>

      <p>Responsive web design has become somewhat of an industry standard with the proliferation of tablets, smart phone, and other devices that break from the early 2000s convention of computer displays. The need for responsive design arose from the fact that most web layouts for the same on every platform. Thus, it's become the challenge of web designers to consider these changes. </p>

      <h2>Fluid Layouts</h2>
      <p>Fluid layouts are web layouts that have implemented different style rules at pixel breakpoints established in a websites stylesheet. If you view a fluid layout on a laptop or desktop browser, you can resize the browser window and watch the layout change as your window crosses certain maximum and minimum widths (i.e. breakpoints). This dynamic effect is essentially why we call them fluid layouts.</p> 

      <p>For understanding these pixel breakpoints I used the Window Resizer<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> plug-in for Chrome. It was quite helpful for establishing important breakpoints for my layout and resizing my window according to device specific widths and heights. In addition, the code is pretty simple to deifine a pixel breakpoint in your style sheet: 
        <p> <center>@media (max-width: value px) { element: value }</center></p>
      </p>

     <p> By using the above code and estlabishing a value for "max-width", you initialize a style change for all @media with a width less than or equal to your established max-width<sup><a href="#2">2</a> <a href="#3">3</a></sup>.</p>

     <p> On this website, the top two sections have a max-width set at 1200px. Below 1201px the second secion falls below the first section. At 1025px the fox size increases to 18px and then to 20px at 640px. The goal here was to make the content easy to read as you decrease the window size. </p>

      The purpose of fluid layouts is to maximize usability. As in the above sec, text that gets bigger as the display gets smaller is easier to read.  Not only does is it easier to read, it also looks better. If you want to guarrentee the best experience for the most users, it's a good idea to implement this sort fluid layouts. There are so many different devices nowadays, and you don't want scare away visitors with outdated layouts that are harder to use.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For this exercise it was very helpful to partner with Danielle, who is a front-end designer. It made implementing these concepts very easy. She was able to direct me as I wrote my syntax and clarify any uncertainty that I had.
        </li>
        <li>Smart phones have added a lot of new elements because they have a different display and a different way of processing code. In the future I see programming integrating a lot of principles from virtual reality and Google Glass. The display will be much more intimate than it is now.</li> 
        <li>My father is actually an occupational therapist that works with kids who are physically and mentally impaired so I have encountered this topic a few times in the past. There exists a number of assistive technologies to help visual and hearing impaired people. In fact, web, tablet and mobile apps have really advanced learning in special ed. Touch screen has played a big part in this. It's just much easier for people to create the interface that physically disabled people need with the sort of programming that is available now.</li> 
        <li>I think the thing that has resonated with me the most is the pixel breakpoints. I never really understood responsive design until I implemented my own responsive code. I feel like creating a fluid layout is a sign of prestige in this industry.</li>
