	<h2 class="important">Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>4 1/2 cups fresh orange juice, divided</li>
	<li>1 1/4 cups fresh lime juice, divided</li>
	<li>1 orange, zested</li>
	<li id="superduperserial">1 lime, zested</li>
	<li>1/2 cup finely chopped fresh oregano, divided</li>
	<li>12 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
	<li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
	<li>1 bone-in pork shoulder (about 4 to 6-pounds), trimmed of excess fat</li>
	<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
	<li>Mojo Dipping Sauce, recipe follows</li>
	<li>Plantains with Rum and Brown Sugar, recipe follows</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h2 class="important">Directions</h2>
	<ol>
	<li>Combine 4 cups of the orange juice and 1 cup of the lime juice and zest in a large saucepan over high heat and reduce to 2 cups. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining orange juice and lime juice add a few cloves of garlic and 1/4 cup of the oregano. Let cool to room temperature.</li>

	<li>Using a paring knife, make small slits over the entire surface of the pork and rub the garlic into the slashes. Whisk together the oil and remaining 1/4 cup of the oregano in a large roasting pan, add the pork and turn to coat, cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.</li>

	<li id="superduperserial">Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>

	<li>Remove the pork from the refrigerator 30 minutes before roasting. Season the pork with salt and pepper and cook for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and continue roasting, basting with the marinade during the last 30 minutes of roasting until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reaches 150 degrees F. Remove from the oven, baste with any remaining glaze, tent loosely and let rest 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
