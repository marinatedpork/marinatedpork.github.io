		<h1>Analysis of Three Favorite Websites</h1>



<h2><a href="http://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">reddit.com</a></h2>

	<p>Reddit is the greatest site on the planet because it provides up-to-date user curated content.  Everything posted and commented can be upvoted and downvoted. Things that are upvotes to most receive the most visibility. Users receive "karma" for the post, and that karma accumulates. People want their karma to increase instead of a decrease, which incentivizes them to post good content So, quality it sorted the aggregate downvotes, which is driven my the karma incentive.  The result is awesome and hilarious content.</p>

	<p>The website is not the prettiest, to be honest. When I look at the site immediately, my eyes are drawn to the left most side of the side that displays thumbnails and the upvote/downvote buttons.  This definitely brings me to interact with it because I want to start clicking on stuff. If I click upvote/downvote, I must sign in.  This is good for the creators because it drives user signups.</p>

	<p>White, text-based, simple, numbers, links -- these are the words I would use to describe reddit.com visually.</p> 

	<p>Funny, informative, community-based, social, opinionated -- theses are the words that I would use to describe reddit.com functionally.</p>

	<p>There are not many options, and since it is that simple it is quite easy to find what I am looking. There is a search bar in the top right corner of the window, but the search function is not that good and often doesn't yield what you want.</p>

	<p>It is quite easy to browse, as you really just find something that intrigues you and then click the link to see/read more. There are add-ons though that optimize the interaction with the page though. For example, you have to click next page to browse further down the feed. That is actually kind of annoying if you want to mindlessly browse reddit for like 5 hours a day. So, someone actually made a reddit enhancement suite that auto loads the next page underneath the current page if you scroll the bottom.</p>

	<p>Being on this website makes me want to spend my life accumulating tons of useless internet points and reading all about people weird experiences and life pro tips they can give you.</p>

	<p>The site kind of sells stuff. There is something called "reddit gold" the purpose of reddit gold is purely to support the website reddit. It was implemented because as the site gained popularity, they needed more money to support increase in users. They invented reddit gold, which is something that you give to other users if you really like their post/comment.  I have actually both given and received reddit gold. I gave reddit gold to a guy who said something so unexpected adn hilarious that I actually started crying I was laughing so hard. I spent $5 to tell him that he is funny, basically. I received reddit gold because I shared a really funny story that was pertinent to a controversial topic. There are also ads that you can purchase on reddit but I do not see those because I have ad block. I will likely purchase reddit gold again.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.imgur.com" target="_blank">imgur.com</a></h2>

	<p>Imgur is an image hosting website that makes it extremely easy to upload and host images. In addition, the images have a very short URL, so when you insert them into code or a post, they don't complicate the syntax too much.  Another reason why this site is awesome is because it is extremely usable.  To host an image, you goto their website, then drag and drop your image into the browser and it will be automatically uploaded. Boom. Done -- so easy.</p>

	<p>My eyes are immediately drawn to the top right corner of the screen that says "Upload Images" and has three buttons under it: Computer, Web, and "Make Meme". This makes a lot of sense because immediately you see how to use the function that is the purpose for the website.</p>

	<p>Basic, dark, thumbnails, comments, upload -- these are the words I would use to describe imgur visually.</p>

	<p>Easy, fast, simple, helpful, fun -- these are the words I would use to describe imgur functionally.</p>

	<p>If you are going the site to upload an image, you don't have to do much searching.  The upload option is right in front of you.  If you are on another page it is still quite simple: the only other pages are images and albums of images all with comments. At the top there is a button labelled "imgur" that brings you back to the homepage and next to that button there is a button for uploading an image. So no matter where you are on the site, you can always carry out it's funciton.</p>

	<p>It is extremely easy to browse the content of the website because the layout is so dang simple.</p>

	<p>After being on the website, I feel bored because I don't need to upload anything and I don't feel like browsing images.</p>

	<p>The site does have a store that sells funny stickers, shirts and other branded items. I actually had no idea that the store existed I wrote the previous sentence. I have ad block so any advertisements for the store will not show up on my computer. The only link to the store is a very tiny link at the bottom of the page that says "store". I have never purchased anything from this site, and I don't think I will anytime soon.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.netflix.com" target="_blank">netflix.com</a></h2>

	<p>Netflix is an amazing website because it has simplified my video/TV experience. It is incredibly easy to use and the layout it very simple: banner with announcements, small frame at the top for home/account/search options, and move/TV recommendations below.</p>

	<p>My eye is immediately drawn to the banner-reel that occupies about 80% of the homepage. Standing back further, my eye is still drawn to these banners. I would say that this is not the most important part of the website because it's not necessarily the content I am looking for. It is certainly important in the eyes of Netflix, because they want you to know what's new and featured on the site.</p>

	<p>Movies, thumbnails, gray, cluttered, basic -- these are the words I would use to describe Netflix visually.</p>

	<p>Easy, too-many-options, needs-more-game-of-thrones, can't-decide-what-to-watch, still-can't-decide -- these are the words I would use to describe netflix.</p>

	<p>It is very easy to find what I am looking for because there is a frame at the top, which is always displayed on the screen, and within that frame there is a search option. The search engine on the website is very good.</p>

	<p>It's too easy to browse the content. Honestly, I wish it were harder. I spend more time browsing netflix than I do watching stuff. The homepage has about 3 years of video content on it alone.</p>

	<p>After being on the website for awhile, I feel like I should get back to DBC work or just go read a book. There are too many options, and I am not much a TV person anyways.</p>

	<p>Netflix sells plans for their service, that is all. I have not purchased or subscirbed to any of their plans but my parents and roommate have, so I definitely get the hook-up. I definitely see myself signing up in the future though.</p>
