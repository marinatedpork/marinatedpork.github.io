			<h1>Learning How to Navigate</h1>

			<h3>A look into my own pairing obstacle.</h3>
			<p>My biggest obstacle in pairing is when I am not the driver. I find it very easy to pair if myself or both my pair and I are coding.  But, when I need to just take the back seat without the ability to tinker around, explaining my ideas line by line gets kind of frustrating at times.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I know exactly why, too. It’s because my style of coding is highly driven on testing and constant repetition. Super fast trial and error is how I work through each of the steps and is where my learning occurs. So if I can’t fiddle around with the code, I have a hard time articulating what must be done.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The fact of this obstacle alone necessitates a need to develop this skill. Obviously I can’t just live a life where I only show and never tell. Perhaps, too, I am misconceiving of how to maximize my impact as a navigator. Maybe I shouldn’t think of navigating in terms of finding the immediate solution or showing the driver how to drive. Maybe I ought to simply ensure we’re staying on course and that what we’ve covered is rightly done.</p>
			<br>
			<p>If I am working with a programmer who is, in all intents and purposes, equal to me in skill, I might focus my attention elsewhere than on what loop we should use on our hash. For example, I could look back at lines we’ve already written, watch for syntax errors and consider ways of refactoring. I could consider how our code will fit into the overall scope of the project. What are we going to do next? How are these methods going to fit together? Should we make a subclass? Are there any misplaced keywords? </p>
			<br>
			<p>There was actually a study done that showed an increase in correctness for complex systems that were developed by programming pairs. Yet if I am to pair program, I still should address this obstacle of having a hard time articulating coding. Truth is there is only one way to effectively do that: navigate in more pairing, take the back seat, practice, listen to feedback and chill out.</p>
