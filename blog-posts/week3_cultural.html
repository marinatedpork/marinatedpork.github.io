			<h1>Trapped in My Own Head</h1>
			<h2>Jul 30, 2014</h2>
			<h3>A closer look at my Gregorc thinking styles.</h3>
			
			<p>The results of my thinking-style tests were not too surprising, but they definitely helped me abstract my own behavior in order to better self-reflect. I take to three of the Gregorc thinking styles: <em>abstract random</em>, <em>abstract sequential</em>, <em>concrete random</em>. It might seem strange to sum up my own behavior in a blog post, but this is how these thinking styles manifest in me:</p>
			<br>
			<p>When it comes to programming, I like to work alone but have access to experts and resources. Before I applied to DBC, I called and emailed every single person who I knew was a developer and picked their brains for hours about it. If I encounter a problem, I like using an impulsive and fast experimentation and trial-and-error approaches to identify the problem. If I get an error message, I will try every possibility of syntax that I can think of before looking going back to Google. Despite my enjoyment of working alone, though, I collaborate well with other people and I like to be diplomatic if I trying to convince someone of something. Establishing and maintaining friendly relationships is always a priority for me as I am a sentimental thinker.</p>
			<br>
			<p>That all makes me sound way more virtuous than I feel. Probably because there are obvious and annoying drawbacks to these styles of thinking. I am sometimes terrible at giving exact details and really have a hard time working with people if they don’t seem friendly or are too authoritarian. I also have a hard time concentrating on one thing at a time. It’s all kind of a problem. But hey, that’s what <em>meta-cognition is for</em>!</p>
			<p>There have been struggles, too, born from these ways of thinking. Honestly, my biggest struggle has been my trial and error approach, which is funny because it can also be my greatest advantage in some cases because it makes things really fast if I know the answer. Still, I can easily burn through an hour of messing around with syntax before I go back and re-read the question to make sure I am not going down some insane rabbit hole.</p>
<br>
			<p>Furthermore, I think I am out of balance and am weakened by my lack of <em>concrete sequential</em> thinking. On many occasions, I have not taken time to read the question and look at what is actually in front of me before moving on to actually answer the question I am being asked. Like, I think that’s why I took so long to complete part 4 of week three’s work. Seriously kept trying different combinations of syntax for tarah’s kid for like an hour. Then I went to my roof and meditated, which was nice.</p>
<br>
			<p>Still, I don’t want to subscribe to the “fixed” mindset. Thus, the question becomes: how can I avoid the pitfalls of my own brains? Well, the biggest problem is impulsive, random persistence that gets me caught in a loop for hours when really I just need to read the question. So, I want to implement what I will call a <strong>problem time limit</strong>. This time limit will be, say, 20 minutes? And if I cross the 20 minute threshold I will re-examine my behavior and try to look at things in an explicitly concrete sequentialist framework.</p>
<br>
			<p>I think my key here is mindfulness. I truly believe that by way of self-examination and mindfulness one can change their behavior to achieve a greater self than before.</p>
