			<h1>The Frozen North</h1>
			<h2>September 8, 2014</h2>
			<h3>Looking my place on the compass of shame</h3>
			<p>When I look at the compass of shame, it’s not much of a secret to me how I deal with conflict. My behavior falls on the North side of the compass. This means I withdraw from situations in which I am confronted by tension or displeasure by getting quiet and closing myself off.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This is not a good thing, either. I try to overcome it, as I have been alive long enough to realize it’s not a particularly proactive strategy. Sometimes, though, my compulsion gets the best of me.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Without a doubt the worst of these times was at one of my previous jobs. It was a workplace that only had about three to four people working at a time. Everything we did was together and as a team, so it was quite evident when there was conflict amidst the group. Furthermore, the stress of our workplace was a huge source of conflict. Our success was measured by efficiency, and efficiency meant complete coherence and focus from everyone on the team. So, if you came to work tired, hungry, angry or perhaps anything other than 100%, things would not go as smoothly and people would get frustrated.</p>
			<br>
			<p>After working there for sometime, I was ready to move onto a different job. Leaving of course meant that our team would be operating at 75%, making efficiency and success itself difficult to maintain. I knew this would upset my boss, too, because the busy month of 80 hour weeks was just ahead. I got nervous and stressed out about how my boss would react to me finding a new job. What I did as a result of this stress was probably the worst thing I could have done to everyone in the situation: nothing.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I just didn’t tell him that I was even looking for a new job or that I had gotten one, even though I had known months before my start date. I decided that I would “just put in a two week notice”, like I’d done at all my other jobs in the past.  The problem, though, is that two week notice would come two weeks before the busiest part of the season. Wow, what a d-bag move.  And it was all because I wanted to avoid confronting the problem and having to work so many more weeks in that post-confrontation environment.</p>
			<br>
			<p>When I came to giving my two week notice, it went a lot worse than I thought. In my head I imagined someone just receiving the news of my resignation and just accepted it as is. But, what I hadn’t realized is how much of an idiot I was being by essentially making the lives of co-workers, who were my friends, worse by leaving when I did. This fact became infinitely clear to me by the extreme disappointment of my boss who would be affected the most by my absence.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Leading up to that moment I had been selfish. I was young and had been thinking of jobs as separate from who I was. The fact that your integrity in your career is a reflection of who you are everywhere else was without me. After all, our company wasn’t corporation with hundreds of employees and applicants ready to fill the gaps. It was a small business born from the sweat and blood of the few people I had worked with for so long. Something I got a chance to be a part of because someone decided it was a good to hire me. I underestimated what I meant to the team and overlooked the needs of the people who I had accomplished so much with.</p>
			<br>
			<p>What I did from there was something I can say I am proud of (re: <a href="http://marinatedpork.github.io/blog-posts/week7_cultural.html">last week’s culture blog</a>). I realized, with the help of some - shall we say - aggressive encouragement from my co-workers, that I was more or less being a total jerk. I emailed the folks at my new job and explained to them that very fact (sugar-coated, of course, in rhetorical devices). I stayed an extra month and kicked ass with the awesome people I worked with. We finished off the season smoother than ever and I started my new jobs knowing that I hadn’t left my people hangin’.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Ever since then, I have been very explicit and transparent to my team and company when I am looking for something new and when I would leave, should I find something. It is my intention to not avoid conflict like I did in the story above. Instead, I want to embrace it as a proactive approach to mitigating problems.</p>
