			<h1>The culture of Dev Bootcamp</h1>
			<p>The DBC culture appears to be one that I may flourish in. I am a very interactive person that loves talking things through with others and helping out when I can. I am very excited to get into the classroom and do some peer pairing in real life.</p>

			<p>My first impression of DBC is that it strikes a balance between relaxed and focused. There is this certain air of work hard play hard that I am picking up on.</p>

			<p>I see myself fitting in well with this culture. After speaking with a number of the other folks in my cohort, I am quite excited to get into the classroom.</p>

			<p>My expectations have not changed</p>

			<p>What makes me nervous is staff members speaking so much about asking people withdraw or holding them back. I don't want to be a straggler!</p>
