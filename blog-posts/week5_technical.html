			<h1>Thinking about thinking</h1>
			<h2>August 17, 2014</h2>
			<h3>A brief look at Object Oriented Programming and Ruby Classes</h3>

			<p>It’s important to keep in mind that programming languages like Ruby are built on a foundation of other, underlying computer science principles. It’s because of this that Object Oriented Programming (OOP) confuses people who are just getting into coding.  We are simply so far removed from much of the hard computer science behind what our code is doing and what it represents. So not having a strong background in computer science can give OOP an almost magical essence. How exactly does my computer read a Sublime file and output the return of a method on the interface? How does it know that a “hash” is a binary tree with values like “name” or “age” and values like “Matt” and “25”?  To a novice developer, the answers are unknown.</p>

					<br>
			<p>A tool, though, that is common throughout each of these steps - that is, from the hard computer science to the soft - is abstraction. This is how programmers make life easier and faster. From discussing code to writing code, abstraction is the act of giving things with common attributes and behaviors a name.  What do we call a living thing with fur that has four legs and barks? A dog. The word “dog” is an abstraction of things with dog-like attributes and behaviors. It makes our life easier if we can say “I adopted a dog” than saying “I adopted a living thing with fur that has four legs and barks”. </p>

					<br>
			<p>We can abstract on things almost ad infinitum. A living thing with fur that has four legs and barks is a dog, and it is also a mammal. A mammal is an animal. An animal is like an abstraction that contains other abstractions.</p>

			<h3>Classes in Ruby</h3>
			<p>In Ruby, we use classes like abstractions: to group things with common attributes and behaviors. For example, the number 1 is in the Fixnum class. The Fixnum class is in the Integer class. The Integer class is in the Numeric class, which is in the Object class which is in the BasicObject class. Beyond BasicObject there is nil -- nothing at all. Go ahead and try it in your IRB:</p>

<pre class="brush: rb">
1.class
=>Fixnum

1.class.superclass
=>Integer

1.class.superclass.superclass
=>Numeric

1.class.superclass.superclass.superclass
=>Object

1.class.superclass.superclass.superclass.superclass
=>BasicObject

1.class.superclass.superclass.superclass.superclass.superclass
=>nil</pre>				
					<br>

			<p>BasicObject is like the carbon of the Rubyverse. All things derive from BasicObject. Such is the hierarchy of Ruby.</p>
					<br>

			<p>This Class-structure of Ruby was written with four underlying principles of OOP: data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. These terms sound scary, but they are actually quite simple. After having become familiar with Ruby, their simplicity is almost intuitive to the point that it might even seem redundant to discuss them.  They nevertheless provide a healthy structure for learning any OOP languages. For the following discussion, we will use the below example of the class Person:</p>

<pre class="brush: rb">			
class Person
	
  
  def initialize(name, age, city)
    @info = {
      name: name,
      age: age,
      city: city,
      alive: true
      }
  end
					
				  
  def who_is?
    return @info
  end
					
				  
  def eat
    raise ArgumentError, "They can't eat when they're dead!" unless @info[:alive] == true
    puts "Yum! I just ate some food."
  end
					
				  
  def die
    @info[:alive] = false
    puts "#{@info[:name]} has died!"
  end
					
				  
end</pre>
					

					<br>
			<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> refers to the packaging of data and methods, and hiding them in one component. In regards to the Person class, the methods .die, .eat, .initialize .who_is? and the variable @info are hidden within the confines of the class Person, and are therefore inaccessible to objects outside the class Person. So typing .who_is? on the fixnum 1 returns an error, as that method is not packaged in the fixnum class.</p>  

					<br>
			<p><strong>Data Abstraction</strong> is something you should not take too seriously because it might just confuse you. It is organizing the data so that there is a difference between the abstract data type and concrete implementation of the data. For Ruby, this means creating a class whose attributes and behaviors appear, syntactically, like the thing that we want to create. For example, in the class Person, the abstract meaning of the method .die is not at all similar to the literal, computation methodology that carries out the .die method, as the computer itself is not killing anything. Instead, we’ve merely given it the name .die for our own conception of the behaviors of a Person object.</p>

					<br>
			<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is when a class takes on the attributes and behavior of another class or superclass. For example, let’s say that we can to create a subclass to the Person class called Wizard that still has the same attributes and behaviors as the Person class. We can it like so:</p>

<pre class="brush: rb">				
class Wizard < Person
end

					
Wizard.new("Gandalf", 2000, "Valinor").eat
=>Yum! I just ate some food.

Wizard.new("Gandalf", 2000, "Valinor").die
=>Gandalf has died!

Wizard.new("Gandalf", 2000, "Valinor").who_is?
=>{:name=>"Gandalf", :age=>2000, :city=>"Valinor", :alive=>true}</pre>
					

					<br>
			<p>The Wizard class thus inherits all attributes and behaviors of the Person class. We can then build upon the attributes of the Person class and give Wizard it’s own attributes and behaviors. Let’s do this by giving our Wizard class a method for casting a spell:</p>
					
<pre class="brush: rb">
class Wizard < Person
					
  def cast_spell
    puts "#{@info[:name]} has casted a spell using level 99 magic!"
  end
					
end
			
Wizard.new("Gandalf", 2000, "Valinor").cast_spell
=>Gandalf has casted a spell using level 99 magic!</pre>
					

					<br>
			<p>The use of inheritance in developing can save a lot of time, so one ought to keep it in mind.</p>

					<br>
			<p><strong>Polymorphism</strong> literally means “many forms”. In OOP, we use this word to describe methods and attributes that are interpreted differently per the type of object on which they are used. For example, our Person class has the .die method. However, we might want to make our Wizard’s .die method more fitting to how we think of wizards, so let’s polymorph .die:</p>
					
<pre class="brush: rb">
class Wizard < Person
					
  def cast_spell
    puts "#{@info[:name]} has casted a spell using lightning!"
  end

					
  def die
    puts "Fly you fools!"
   @info[:alive] = false
  end

					
end

					
Wizard.new("Gandalf", 2000, "Valinor").die
=> Fly you fools!</pre>
					

					<br>
			<p>Now, let’s look at how our polymorphic method behaves. Let’s ake an array that has one Wizard class object and one Person class object, iterate through them with the .die method and see the difference:</p>
<pre class="brush: rb">			
sentients = [ Wizard.new("Gandalf", 2000, "Valinor"), Person.new("Matt", 25, "Chicago") ]
sentients.each do |x| puts x.die 
end

					
=> Fly you fools!
=> Matt has died!</pre>

					
					<br>
