			<h1>().group_by</h1>
<h2>August 5, 2014</h2>
<h3>Three cool uses of the ().group_by method</h3>

<p>The method <strong>().group_by { |x| block }</strong> groups a collection in a hash by the result of the code within the block. In other words, you can take a collection and separate it however you want. How is that useful? Let’s check out some of the stuff you can do with this method, so we can get a better understanding of how to use it.</p>

<h2>1. Organize Items in a Hash by Value:</h2>

<p>Watch how we call the ().group_by on the ages hash by separating each key/value pair by value to figure out who we can take to the bar:</p>

<pre class="brush: rb">
$ ages = { 
  "Matt" => 15,
  "Ben" => 32,
  "Bryan" => 10,
  "Shan" => 43,
  "Charlie" => 23,
}

(ages).group_by { |key, value| value > 20}

=> { false=>[ [ "Matt", 15 ], [ "Bryan", 10 ] ], 
     true => [ [ "Ben", 32 ], [ "Shan", 43 ], [ "Charlie", 23 ] ] }</pre>

<br>

<h2>2. Separate Prime Numbers in a Series:</h2>

<p>Find the prime numbers in a range for some really high-level math stuff, like for a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=3">Project Euler problem</a> or something. Notice here, we require the “prime” class so we can access the method .prime? that we use in the block.</p>

<pre class="brush: rb">
require 'prime'

(10..70).group_by { |number| number.prime? }

=> { false => [ 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 
	  21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 
	  30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 
	  39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 
	  49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 
	  57, 58, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 
	  66, 68, 69, 70], 
    true => [ 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 
      37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67 ] } </pre>
<br>
<h2>3. Organize Data on a Conditional:</h2>

<p>You can also group boolean statements. Below, ().group_by takes the members of the array “family” and isolated the names that start with the letter ‘m’ and those that don’t:</p>

<pre class="brush: rb">
family = [ "Matt", "Danny", "Gina", "Margaret", "Mike" ]
(family).group_by { |x| x[0].downcase === 'm'}

=> { true=>[ "Matt", "Margaret", "Mike" ], 
     false => [ "Danny", "Gina" ] }</pre>

<p>Those are just three of the cool things we can do with ().group_by. Go ahead and open up your IRB and experiment. Can you think of anything else that you  To read more about it <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-group_by">check it out here</a>.<p>
