			<h1>Wearable Technology</h1>

			<h3>How do we go from geek to chic?</h3>

			<p>When I first saw a person wearing Google Glass in public my first thoughts were that wearing Google Glass feel like Gordy La Forge aboard the Starship Enterprise -- scanning people’s pulses and blood pressures. Winning every poker night because I could see when people are lying. Looking like a complete dweeb all the time. I could see Google Glass even affecting my personality. Like, the way I look at people would change. Not on purpose, but I know it’d change - for the worse. Why? Because the swag-level of Google Glass is permanently set to zero.</p>
<br>

			<p>The above narrative is not too far from the mainstream perception of wearable-tech, which is huge problem for the industry. Despite the projected industry growth from $8 billion to $50 billion in the next five years, the perception of wearing a device in public still seems geeky to most people.</p>
<br>

			<p>One writer has explained the “nerd bait” image of wearable tech is problematic because it sells the device based on its cutting-edge capabilities - not the user experience. The devices, then, take on a shade of elitism that separates them from the mainstream. Thus, the wearable-tech just isn’t cool.</p>

			<h3>It just seems so right though...</h3>

			<p>Still, I see the future of smart phones and other devices as being one in which they are attached to me somehow. I can’t explain why, but I know that I am not alone in that. When I imagine the future, I imagine myself wearing a contact lens that displays my geo-coordinates over my immediate line of sight so I can see where I need to go as I am moving through the world. And maybe there’s some computer that can read my thoughts and carries out tasks as I think of them. Technology might be far from that reality, but you get the idea. It does not seem wrong for technology to be worn -- it kind of seems right.</p>
<br>

			<p>Then, why do I still cringe when I see someone making a phone call or taking a photo on their Samsung Galaxy Gear Smart Watch? The answer to that question is likely very superficial - an answer given by my inner-mainstream consumer. Maybe it is because the device looks like an annoyingly non-hipster version of those old calculator watches from the 80s and 90s. Or because it look clunky, lacking an air of effortlessness. </p>

			<h3>But is it hopelessly geeky?</h3>

			<p>No -- at least, not when wearable devices can make an excellent marketing platform, says the marketers. In the last year, advertisers have begun to pursue wearable tech companies as they see an opportunity in the industry’s projected growth. "Any device with a screen allows for an interesting opportunity," says Atul Satija, vice president and head of revenue and operations at inMobi - a mobile ad-maker that is now putting together mock-up ads for wearable tech.</p>
<br>

			<p>These marketers may be the solution to the problem wearable-tech’s image.  It would not be the first time that the work of marketing brings a tech industry into the mainstream. Consider Apple. One writer at Wired magazine point outs how Apple changed the image of computers with a fresh marketing approach. For example, compare this 1976 Apple ad to this one run a decade later. Astonishing. </p>
<br>

			<p>I must admit, though, it is slightly discomforting that mainstream culture must rely on the image crafting of advertisers to show us that something is good or useful. Nevertheless, it’s the money that mainstream consumers provide that allows large companies to develop even greater products that could make our lives better. Wearable tech promises tons of data for all sorts of things -- like healthy living. Furthermore, data can lead to insight and discovery.</p>
<br>

			<p>But wherever we’re headed, I think it’s going to take some really well produced marketing to up the coolness factor on wearable devices. Either that or the next Gangnam Style should require some kind of wearable device.</p>
