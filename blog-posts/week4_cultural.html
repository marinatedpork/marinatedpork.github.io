			<h1>Wearable Technology and Mainstream Culture</h1>

			<h3>How do we go from geek to chic?</h3>

			<p>When I first saw a person wearing <a href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google glasses</a> in public, a delightfully humorous image of Gordy La Forge (pictured above) from Star-Trek: The Next Generation came mind. “Is this person scanning my vitals?” I thought, pondering their optical regalia. “What power do they have over me?” I imagined myself wearing the high-tech head-piece, wondering how it might affect my personality and how I might be perceived by others. If I were surfing the web, would observers think I was staring off into space? I bet the way I look at people would change. Maybe it would become hollow or impersonal somehow -- swipe left, swipe right -- suddenly the whole world is Tinder. Honestly, though, I couldn’t say what it would do to me, because I can’t see myself wearing them. They look too... lame.</p>
<br>

			<p>The above narrative is not too far from the general perception of wearable-tech, which is a huge obstacle for the industry. How can you expect a trendy consumer to purchase something that looks really awkward - even if it is provided some increased good. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/28/5556776/marc-newson-says-google-glass-is-pretty-stupid">It’s like the Segway</a> all over again. Despite the projected industry growth from $8 billion to $50 billion in the next five years, it might be hard for these devices to become mainstream. Some people think their dorky, while others go as far as saying <a href="http://gawker.com/5990395/if-you-wear-googles-new-glasses-you-are-an-asshole">they make you an asshole</a>.</p>
<br>

			<p>PR and branding is a strange creature. It allows us to sell a product without talking about the product at all. But, the “nerd bait” image of wearable tech, says one writer, is a problem because it sells the device based on its cutting-edge capabilities - not the user experience. The devices, then, take on an unattractive shade of elitism, which separates them from the mainstream.</p>

			<h3>Consider the possibilities.</h3>

			<p>Still, I agree with proponents of wearable tech and their creators. I, too, imagine a future in which my iPhone is somehow attached to me. I can’t explain why, but I know that I am not alone in that. When I think of the year 2050, I imagine myself wearing a contact lens that displays my geo-coordinates over my immediate line of sight so I can see where I need to go as I am moving through the world. And maybe there’s a computer that can read my thoughts and carries out tasks as I think of them. “I am in danger - please help!,” I might think and immediately the authorities and my loved ones are alerted. We might not even be too far from this technology, either. Regardless, it does not seem wrong for technology to be worn -- it kind of seems right.</p>
<br>

			<p>Yet, why do I slightly cringe when I see someone taking a photo on their Samsung Galaxy Gear Smart Watch? The answer to that question is likely very superficial - an answer given by my inner-mainstream consumer. Maybe it is because the device looks like an annoyingly non-hipster version of those old calculator watches from the 80s and 90s. Or because it looks chunky, lacking an air of effortlessness. Google has the right idea, but need to be a bit more subtle before it really takes hold. For now, it just looks like whoever wears Google Glass is in a constant state of distraction.
</p>

			<h3>But is it hopeless?</h3>

			<p>It’s not a lost cause. After all, computers use to be geeky, and now some are trendy. In fact, geeks use to be geeky. Now half the people I meet subtly brag at some about how much of a “nerd” they are. The type of sentiment that goes along with binge watching television series and being “anti-social”.  But, that’s not the real reason wearable devices will win out. How could we let such a great marketing platform go to waste?</p>
<br>
			<p>In the last year, advertisers have begun to pursue wearable tech companies because the industry’s projected growth makes them quiver with the exciting thought of having another way to sell us stuff. It’s like Facebook except attached to your body. "Any device with a screen allows for an interesting opportunity," <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140712/business/140719838/">says Atul Satija</a>, vice president and head of revenue and operations at inMobi - a mobile ad-maker that is now putting together mock-up ads for wearable tech.</p>


			<p>These marketers may be the solution to the problem of wearable-tech’s non-mainstream image. It wouldn’t be the first time that the noble work of good marketing brings a tech industry into the mainstream circuit. Of course, one cannot speak of technology and marketing without mentioning Apple. Lisa Calhoun of Wired Magazine <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/05/how-to-fix-wearable-techs-bad-image-problem">makes a good case for re-branding wearables</a> by she pointing out how Apple changed the image of computers with a fresh marketing approach. Compare <a href="http://www.macmothership.com/gallery/newads7/1976apple1.jpg">this 1976 Apple ad</a> to <a href="http://www.macmothership.com/gallery/Newsweek2/nw4.jpg">this one run a decade later</a>. It’s like suddenly I’m questioning what a computer is.</p>
<br>
			<p>I must admit, though, it is slightly discomforting that mainstream culture must rely on the image crafting of advertisers to show us that something is good or useful. Nevertheless, it’s the money that mainstream consumers provide that allows large companies to develop even greater products that could bear a concrete benefit to our lives. Wearable tech promises tons of data for all sorts of things -- like healthy living. Data can lead to insight and discovery.</p>
<br>

			<p>Yet even considering what’s necessary for wearable tech to become trendy, I find myself eager to see what sort of guise it is packaged in. What would David Ogilvy do to make every teenage girl in the world want a pair high tech frames on their face? What will the world look like when someone has accomplished that? When people first used telephones, they could have never imagined the smartphone. Now with the capabilities of technology being so great, what could possibly turn us on our heads again?</p>
