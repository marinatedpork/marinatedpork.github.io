			<h3>How I think of the great moments in life.</h3>
			<p>Week seven’s cultural blog is quite a treat. Consider your greatest moments in life, they ask, and choose from about one hundred values those of which you identify in these moments. While everyone’s been waving the not-a-big-deal flag at the notion of listing their life’s greatest moments, I’ve been stuck and confounded. Does everyone know their greatest moments in life off the top of their head?</p>
			<br>
			<p>I would say that a lot of people do. A friend of mine with a newborn baby told me the greatest moment in his life was seeing his daughter come into the world. Other people, meanwhile, have undergone things that in no way compare to what I have gone through in my life. A cancer survivor’s greatest moment in life might be the day he or she beat cancer. An ex-prisoner of war’s happiest moment is probably the moment he or she was freed. An olympic medalist would likely consider winning a medal as his or her greatest moment.</p>
			<br>
			<p>But, what are my proudest, most satisfied moments in life? Let’s just say that, right now, my experiences wouldn’t make a very good episode of This American Life. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve done what some would consider great things. Once I saved a person from drowning in a stream, and I’ve been on a few unforgettable rock climbing trips. I feel proud of those times, but they don’t stand out as anything other than something that happened. That’s because I have a hard time separating good moments from mundane or even bad ones. How can I paint a portrait of myself and measure it’s quality only by the details that I like? Why not look at my whole life and find satisfaction in all of it?</p>
			<br>
			<p>People are predisposed to think of great moments as things that belong on a Facebook timeline, like getting married or meeting your favorite celebrity. Meanwhile, they’re overlooking those subtle murmurs of contentment buzzing along in the instant. All the time that goes unnoticed. Like that day I got off work early and went for a walk along the lake, then caught the bus in time to meet a friend at the Blue Line. Or the weeks I’d spend reading and thinking to myself alongside a whirring stream in San Juan mountains of Colorado.</p> 
			<br>
			<p>By appreciating all the space between the momentous graduations, weddings, job offers, and every other part of my life that I nostalgically look back at and ask “What next? What can I do to top that?”, I feel a fuller satisfaction with my life. One that is less demanding and more accepting of all the moment’s life has to offer.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And so it is my intention to approach the next months at DBC, as arduous as they may be, as a genuine treat. How great is it that I have the opportunity spend all my days coding away? How cool is it that I get to work with and build relationships with an entirely new group of people? Furthermore, I’d like this optimistic acceptance I discussed above to foster a good learning environment for myself and my peers.</p>
