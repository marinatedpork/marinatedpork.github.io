			<h1>The Use of Method in Modules and Classes</h1>
			<h2>August 24, 2014</h2>
			<h3>class instance method, module instance methods, and module functions</h3>
			<br>
			<p>In short, I would summarize modules as collections of tools that we use on and include in classes. In this post, I want to briefly look at a few functional differences in terms of how we use methods when working with classes, mixins, and modules.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Classes are constructors used to create instances of themselves. If you have a class that is used only for a method or function, then you are misusing the class construct. In such a case you would use a module, which is intended to be a collection or library of methods and constants. For example, if you have methods that you want to use across multiple classes, then you would create a module to store those methods. So if you have code that logically belongs together but will not be used to create instances, then a module is the correct construct. </p>
			<br>
			<p>What really helped me understand the functional difference between modules and classes was how each use methods. Let’s look at three are different method types: class instance method, module instance methods, and module functions.</p>
			<br>
			<p>A class instance method is one that you write into your class for example:</p>
<pre class="brush: rb">	
class Cls
			
	def class_method
		puts "This is a class method. I work on this class." 
	end
			
end
			
c = Cls.new
c.class_method
=> "This is a class method. I work on this class."
			
#class_method can then only be used on ones on instances of classes that are of or inherit the class Cls</pre>
			<br>
			<p>A module instance method is a method that is written into a module but can only be used on classes that has that includes the module. Check out the example below:</p>
<pre class="brush: rb">
module Mod
			
	def instance_method
		puts "I am an instance method. I am used by mixing this module with a class."
	end
			
end
			
			
class Cls
			
include Mod	
			
	def class_method
		puts "This is a class method. I work on this class."
	end
				
end
			
c = Cls.new
b = Mod
c.instance_method
=> 'I am an instance method. I am used by mixing this module with a class.'
b.instance_method
=> Error</pre>
			<br>
			<p>Then there are module functions which are methods that are only usable on modules. One creates a module function simply by creating a method on lines below “module_function” syntax. For example, let’s create a module function in our Mod module and try to use it on both a class and a module:</p>
<pre class="brush: rb">	
module Mod
			
	def instance_method
		puts "I am an instance method. I am used by mixing this module with a class."
		# Can only be used on mixin.
	end
					
	module_function
				
	def mod_func
		puts "I am a module function. I only work on a module."
		# Can only be called by a module
	end
				
end
			
			
class Cls
			
include Mod	
			
	def class_method
		puts "This is a class method. I work on this class." 
	end
				
end
			
c = Cls.new
b = Mod
b.mod_func
=> 'I am a module function. I only work on a module.'
c.mod_func
=> Error
c.instance_method
=> 'I am an instance method. I am used by mixing this module with a class.'</pre>
			<br>
			<p>The idea behind separating classes and modules is simply to create a more streamlined workflow. Organizing methods and constants into a library makes it a lot easier to to use them in a number of different places and can save time for rewriting different methods. I would say that this falls into Ruby’s separation of concerns. As someone who is a beginner, it seems to me that I will be using modules much more when I have methods that I want to use across multiple apps in Rails, for example. For example, a credit card validation system may likely be used across a number of sites. So it might be a good idea to create a Luhn module.</p>
