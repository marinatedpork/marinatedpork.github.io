			<h1>How to Ask the Right Questions</h1>
			<h2>September 9, 2014</h2>
			<h3>Spending more time on forming questions can save a lot of frustation</h3>
			<p>Going into DBC, I tried to connect with as many people as I could who were developers. I remember this becoming a serious priority when I was going through <a href="http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html">Learn Ruby on Rails by Daniel Kehoe</a> (Great book). At the time, things like GitHub and terminals were complete mysteries to me. So when I encountered a hiccup going through the tutorial, I had a very, very difficult time sorting it out myself. Even the mighty Google was unable to yield a response that made sense to me. It was then that I realized I really needed someone who I could ask questions to.</p>
			<br>

			<p>After connecting with some old friends who’d entered the dev world far before, I am very grateful to say that I now have a few people who I can casually ask “Wait, what am I missing here?”, and they’ll respond with an informative response (shoutout to George - you know who you are).</p>
			<br>

			<p>Sometimes, though, the process of forming your question and engaging in a dialogue can be enough to give you that “Aha!” moment. This is where the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a> comes from. But when you do have to formally ask a question to to StackOverflow or any forum, keep the following points in mind to ensure you get the right answer for a your hard coding questions:</p>
			<br>
			<div class="indent">
				<h3>1. State your question or explain why you’re having trouble</h3>

				<p>In plain English (or whatever language is spoken), succinctly and clearly ask your question. Explain what is not working for you and what your intention is. Be explicit about any classes, methods or functions that pertain to your question.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>2. Provide your own code and the references used to write it</h3>

				<p>One thing I’ve learned throughout my five billion Google searches for code help, is that it is taboo to simply ask a question and provide no original code of your own. Part of learning how to code is experimenting on your own. Furthermore, it is untactful to simply ask others to do your work for you. If it’s a broader concept, sometime there’s no easy way to provide your own “code” per se, but always provide your initial understand for how you think you might solve your problem.</p>
				<br>

				<p>Furthermore, being as transparent as possible about your own work and how you’ve written it will help clear up anything that someone may need to clarify should they answer your question.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>3. Explain the expected result </h3>

				<p>Now that you’ve asked your question and shown what you’ve done in attempting to solve your problem, it is really helpful for people to know your goal. If you’re trying to find the sum of all numbers in an array, explain why you want that. What is the next step for your project? How does it all fit together? By explaining these details, people might have some great insights that you haven’t thought of yet.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>4. Include keywords wherever possible</h3>

				<p>If you’re asking a question on Stack Overflow or other forums, include keywords in the title of your question and add tags so others may find to either answer it or learn from it. Don’t title your question “How I find the sum of an array?”. Arrays are in like every programming language ever. Be specific or no one will want to help you. Instead title it “How do I find the sum of an array in Ruby?”</p>
				<br>

				<h3>5. Thank anyway who provides an answer</h3>

				<p>People who go out of their way to provide us with free, expert advice deserve to be thanked for what they’ve done. We should be grateful that we are part of an industry in which so many learned developers take time out of their day to point out your syntax errors or explain complicated things to you. Always thank anyone who has given you a good answer.</p>
