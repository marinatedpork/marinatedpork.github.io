			<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
			<h2>August 24, 2014</h2>
			<h3>A brief reflection on my experience</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Stereotype threat is being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype associated with a characteristic of your self-identity to the point that it affects your functioning. It’s like subconsciously thinking you’re being judged for who you are and you start performing differently.</p>
			<br>
			<p>My most notable run-in with this was a couple years backs I did a two summer stint working for the Southwest Conservation Corps -- an Americorp program where you maintain hiking trails. Each May to August I was put on a six to ten person crew with whom I lived and worked for three months. Everyone on the crew came from someplace different. One person was from the Zuni pueblo in New Mexico, another person was a drifter kid who’d gotten bored of train hopping and wanted something steady. There was a first grade teacher and an art student from Boston. Everyone had a different story.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Our time together was rugged. We pumped water by hand from a creek for making food and drinking. We carried everything with us and used no electric or gas powered tools. We lived ten miles away from the nearest highway.</p>
			<br>
			<p>These conditions forced a lot of interesting scenarios for stereotypes. Gender, religion, ethnic group -- at some point during the summer each of us, whether intentional or not, would be marginalized or singled out for some part of their character. The big one though was the gender associations with doing manual labor. Which gender is expected to do the most and hardest tasks? Which do we assume will do the easy stuff or less of the hard stuff? How does this affect a group of five women and five men living together who are cutting trees, making stone walls and hauling dirt?</p>
			<br>
			<p>Long story short: it can create tension. Big, strong guys would get frustrated with the women who were not as strong as they were. Some people would get stuck with certain jobs all the time because that’s what their body was best suited to do. Sometimes it was not a big deal but when you’re rushing to complete a project someone might not like being the only person who can crank a griphoist long enough for the boulder to get across the creek. The hard part too was brushing it all off when you got back to camp after work and want to relax.</p>
			<br>
			<p>So how do you brush it off? People might argue that if you spend enough time with someone eventually you’ll get angry with them. So how do you avoid or ameliorate it if it does occur? You make it fun. You stay mindful of your own weaknesses. If we felt like we were under threat or frustrating people by being tired, weak or unfit for the job, we’d be comically honest with each other about. “Yea, I know I can’t move that stone being my hands are literally half the size of yours.” Someone would say, and suddenly the situation would be less tense and urgent, and the people would mesh a little bit better.</p>
