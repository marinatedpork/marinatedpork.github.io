		<h3>A brief look at JavaScript</h3>
<br>
	<p>There are two main aspects that attract develops to JavaScript:</p>
	<ol>
	<li> Rapid development.</li>
	<li> Maximizing user experience.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>JavaScript is a compact client-side language that gives developers a lot of power for making a dynamic front-end. HTML5 has brought this even further with tags like the drawing canvas that can be enriched by code like JavaScript. One write even comments that HTML5 is really just a language for JavaScript. </p>
<br>
	<p>Not only does it easily deliver the UX that consumers demand, but it does so at a fast pace. Javascript is a lot different than older languages like C++ because it is <em>interpreted</em> rather than <em>compiled</em>, which means you can write it and run it without reformatting and compiling it. This makes for easy testing, which saves tons of time. Although many of us DBC students are use to Ruby, interpreting was new to developers when JavaScript was first used. So, having script run till it hits an error was also new, and it meant faster debugging.</p>
<br>
	<p>JavaScript has come a long way, too. Now with Node.js, developers can take JavaScript to the back-end for building scalable network applications based on Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which integrates well with the cloud computing and NoSQL database movement. After all, many of the popular databases use JSON documents, which are just serialized JavaScript objects. Thus, these databases are fit for JavaScript deployment.</p>
<br>
	<p>There are drawbacks, though. Not only can it take a a lot of knowledge to accomplish basic tasks, JavaScript’s client-side nature means there can be issues when the client and the server communicate.  For example, JavaScript cannot write files on the server without the help of a server-side script, like Ajax. It cannot protect your images or page source, and sometimes layout engines can render the code differently, which results in inconsistency.</p> 
<br>
	<p>Despite these drawbacks, JavaScript is very popular in high school computer courses. So, there’s likely to be at least a few generations of JavaScript programmers to come.</p>
