		<h1>Something in the Coffee:</h1>

		<h3>A brief look at JavaScript</h3>
	<p>Being someone who is new to the dev world, it has become extremely apparent to me that things constantly change and programming languages' abilities always increase. So, when I went out to research JavaScript and all its nuances I could not help but find disagreements between what written sources and current developers say about JavaScript. Despite that, I still feel like I was able to get a fairly good grasp of what makes JavaScript such a big deal today.</p>
	<h2>Quick and Easy</h2>
	<p>What I found is that there are two main aspects that attract developers to JavaScript:</p>
	<ol>
	<li> Maximizing user experience.</li>
	<li> Rapid development.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>JavaScript is a compact client-side language that gives developers a lot of power for making a dynamic front-end. HTML5 has brought this even further with tags like the drawing canvas that can be enriched by code like JavaScript. Some have even gone as far to say that HTML5 is really just a language developed for JavaScript.</p>
<br>
	<p>But not only can it deliver the UX that consumers demand, it does so at a faster pace than older languages. This is because JavaScript is <strong><em>interpreted</em></strong> rather than <strong><em>compiled</em></strong>, which is something many of us DBC students take for granted. Interpreting means you can write it and run it without reformatting and compiling it. This was a huge time saver for programmers, because it gets rid of much of the hard computer science from the programming process. No more worrying about where the program is in correspondence to the hardware and memory. Debugging also became a lot easier because the script would simply interpret until it hit an error.
<br>
<br>
	<p>JavaScript has come a long way, too. Now with Node.js, developers can take JavaScript to the back-end and build scalable network applications based on Google's V8 JavaScript engine. And since many of the popular databases use JSON documents, which are just serialized JavaScript objects, JavaScript goes hand-in-hand with the popularity of cloud computing and NoSQL databases. The product of this is an engine, a programming language and a database all well equipped for tandem deployment.</p>
	<h2>Nothing's Perfect</h2>
	<p>There are drawbacks, though. One developer I spoke to said it can it take a lot of knowledge of the libraries to accomplish basic tasks. The <a href="http://www.about.com">about.com</a> article <i>What JavaScript Can Not Do</i> says that JavaScript’s client-side nature means there can be issues when the client and the server communicate.  For example, JavaScript cannot write files on the server without the help of a server-side script, like Ajax. It cannot protect your images or page source, and sometimes layout engines can render the code differently, which results in inconsistency.</p> 
<br>
	<p>Despite these drawbacks, JavaScript is very popular in high school computer courses. So, there’s likely to be at least a few generations of JavaScript programmers to come.</p>
